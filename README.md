# Traffic_Light_Control_System
A reinforcement learning framework using Deep Q-Learning to optimize traffic signal timing at intersections. Uses SUMO to simulate traffic flow and a neural network to learn optimal light phase selections that minimize vehicle wait times. Features customizable parameters, training/testing workflows, and visualization tools.
